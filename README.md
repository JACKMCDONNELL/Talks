# Talks

I'll keep a copy of all major talks I give from now and on in this directory. These include:

- a talk I gave to the BW Premed Society on 14MAR2018.  
- a presentation I gave for my Observational Studies class at Case Western Reserve on 19APR2018.
- a sentiment analysis of my own tweets (@McDonnellJack)
